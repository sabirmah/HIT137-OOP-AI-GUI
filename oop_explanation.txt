OOP Concepts Used in Our Tkinter + Hugging Face GUI

1. Encapsulation:
   - In the `AIModel` class, the attribute `_model_name` is private.
   - This ensures that model details are hidden from direct access and are acessed only via methods.

2. Inheritance:
   - `TextToImageModel` and `AudioToTextModel` inherit from the base class `AIModel`.
   - They reuse common properties and methods but also define their own behavior.

3. Polymorphism:
   - Both subclasses override the `run_model()` method in their own way.
   - For text input → generate image.
   - For audio input → return transcription.

4. Method Overriding:
   - The base class `AIModel` has in a method `run_model()` which is abstract (not implemented).
   - Each child class (`TextToImageModel`, `AudioToTextModel`) overrides this method with specific functionality.

5. Multiple Decorators:
   - `@log_action` is used to log which function is runnng.
   - `@error_handler` is used to handle runtime errors gracefully.
   - Together, they decorate methods to add extra functionality without changing the core logic.

6. Encapsulation in GUI:
   - In the `GUIApp` class, variables like `self.file_path` are used internally.
   - They cannot be accessed dirctly outside the class without proper methods.

Why these concepts are important:
- Encapsulation makes the program secure and modular.
- Inhritance avoids code repetition.
- Polymorphism allows flexbility when running different models.
- Method overiding makes the base class reusable.
- Decorators make code cleaner and improve debuging/error handling.
